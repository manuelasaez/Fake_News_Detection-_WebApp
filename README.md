# Fake News Detection Web App

## Motivation
In the current digital age, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern. Misinformation can spread rapidly, misleading readers and causing widespread impact. To address this issue, our team embarked on a project to develop a web application that leverages machine learning techniques to detect fake news. This tool aims to assist news portals in verifying the authenticity of articles before publication, ensuring that only credible and verified information reaches the audience.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to first create an algorithm that can predict whether a news article is fake or not. In the second step, we will construct an easy-to-use web application that utilizes this algorithm to accurately identify fake news articles. By providing a reliable verification tool, we aim to enhance the credibility of news portals and contribute to the fight against misinformation.

## Technical Details
Our fake news detection web app is built using Python and incorporates several powerful libraries and tools to achieve high accuracy and performance. Below are the key technical components and libraries used in this project:

## Libraries and Tools:
* scikit-learn: A robust library for machine learning in Python, used for building and training the fake news detection models.
* pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for handling datasets.
* numpy: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, used for various numerical operations.
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for working with human language data, used for text processing and feature extraction.
* TfidfVectorizer: From the scikit-learn library, used to convert text data into numerical features based on term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).
* LogisticRegression: A machine learning algorithm from scikit-learn, used as the primary model for detecting fake news.


## Conclusion
By integrating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and creating a seamless user experience, our fake news detection web app aims to be a valuable tool for news portals and readers alike, promoting the dissemination of accurate and trustworthy information.
